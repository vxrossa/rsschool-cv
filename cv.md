3. I'm a master's student at the Gubkin National University of Oil and Gas who is planning on studying programming and becoming a front-end developer. Right now my main goal is to learn the basics of programming and front-end programming.

4. I started learning HTML and CSS in school several years ago and right now I have enough experience to build simple websites with some responsive elements.
My degree didn't specialize in programming languages, however I have experience with MatLab and Python for simple calculations. Right now I'm learning JavaScript and also plan on learning React.

5. Code example

    Square every digit of a number and concatenate them (7 kyu).
For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1.

```
function sqConcat (num) {
    return +num.toString().split("").map(x => Math.pow(x,2)).join("");
}
console.log(sqConcat("insert any number"));
```
